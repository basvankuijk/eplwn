This project creates a publication list widget that can be embedded on any home page of a researcher.
The publications labeled with a DAI are collected from a large number of distributed sources, institutional repositories.
A DAI is the Digital Author Identifier, a National author number that is used in the Netherlands to uniquely identify a person. This is done by university administration systems called METIS. METIS administration is made to report the yearly knowledge production of a University. When the publications are registered in Metis they are linked with the corresponding author through a National/International DAI. This way authors who have worked in several universities can recollect their contribution of their work from different distributed sources in one widget they can place on their homepage.
The aggregator of the sources this widget uses is called NARCIS.info. When the NARCIS API is fed with a DAI, a  publicationlist comes back in the form of RSS. The Widget  gives the RSS a nice look-and-feel.
